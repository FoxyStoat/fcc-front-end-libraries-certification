But, use this, to summon one another as spirits, cross the gaps between the worlds, and engage in jolly co-operation!",

Lost Izalith, or the Tomb of the Gravelord… ? But I cannot give up. I became Undead to pursue this! But when I peer at the Sun up above, it occurs to me…What if I am seen as a laughing stock, as a blind fool without reason?  Well, I suppose they wouldn't be far off! Hah hah hah!",
